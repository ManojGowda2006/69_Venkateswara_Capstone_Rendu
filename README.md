**# RENDU: Bike Rental Platform**

## **Introduction**
In urban areas, many individuals own bikes but do not use them frequently, while others may require a bike for short-term use. This platform aims to bridge the gap by allowing bike owners to rent out their bikes to those in need. Users can search for nearby available bikes, book them, and complete transactions through a secure system. Bike providers can manage their earnings and withdraw funds at their convenience.

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **full-stack web application** developed using **React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB**. It enables users to **list, search, book, and rent bikes** while ensuring verification through driving licenses. Additionally, a **payment system** will be integrated to handle transactions securely.
